Sender is a wrapper of runtime.send method. 

It construct by calling function Sender with argument 'message', whiche are contain address of reciver. When reciver get a message, it check 'address' field of one. If 'address' don't match, reciver ignore it.

Also message may contain other fields.

var snd = new Sender({address: 'nowhere', action: 'fire!'});

Message don't send automatically. It need to call method 'send' that really send it.

snd.send();

This method also create callback for reciving response. 

Response message store in field 'response'.

Method 'action' may be called, when response arrived, if he have set.

snd.action = function (response) 
{
    console.log("we have a response!", JSON.stringify(response));
}
